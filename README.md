Developed a "Facial Recognition Attendance System" using OpenCV, Keras, PIL, Tensorflow, etc to create this project. 
This program accesses the camera via an Ip webcam application and takes hundreds of facial pictures of one single individual
and trains the model with multiple Convolutional2D filters, maxpool layers, flatten and output layers.
Afterwards, when connected to the camera after the model is been trained it can detect the face of that one particular individual 
among a group of individuals. 
The data about the individual can be stored and the same procedure can be done for other individuals.
This is the mechanism of this project called "Facial Recognition Attendance System", which I did during my internship in
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
